# NBA-MVP-2020
Machine Learning Algorithm that is used to predict the most valuable player in the NBA for the season. (Using R programming)

2020 has been a tumultuous year and one that will go down in the banals of history. Covid 19 put a temprorary stop to alot
of activities that Americans hold dear. One of those activities was the NBA which saw the season come to an abrupt end. 
This however left some interesting questions that need to be solved, and with this algorithm I have done my best to solve one.
I used both a Decision Tree and a Random Forest Algorithm to create 2 machine learning models.
Who should of won the MVP title? View my code to find out.
